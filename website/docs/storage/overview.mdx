Utils and React hooks for working with persisted state in local storage, session storage and IndexedDB.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/storage" />

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/storage

# yarn
yarn add @weser/storage

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/storage
```

## Motivation

Working with persisted state is a core part of any modern application.<br />
Typically, I'd start with some React state and eventually persist it to either a database or a local storage.
Since I found myself writing the same boilerplate code over and over again, I decided to create this package to help me work with persisted state in a more convenient way.

## Benefits

This package provides a set of utilities and React hooks to help you work with persisted state in a more convenient way.
It supports [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), [sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) and [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). You may also plug your very own storage to it.
