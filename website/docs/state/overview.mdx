An [Elm](https://elm-lang.org)-inspired state management library for React that supports asynchronous side effects as a first class citizen. It's super lightweight and uses React's [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) and [useOptimistic](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic) under the hood.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/state" />

## Installation

<Callout title="Required dependencies">
  This package relies on [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hook)
  and thus requires version 16.3 or higher.
</Callout>

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/state

# yarn
yarn add @weser/state

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/state
```

## Motivation

There are many ways to handle state in React, including the built-in [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState), [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) or the fairly new [useOptimistic](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic).<br />
The first two are great, but lack first-class support for side effects (unless you use [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect), which has its very own set of problems) while the latter doesn't really have the most ergonomic API.<br />
That's why I decided to create this package to provide a more ergonomic, low-level API for state management.

## Benefits

This package provides a more ergonomic, low-level API for state management including reducers with side effects and a [useState](/hook/api/useState)-like hook with optimistic updates.
