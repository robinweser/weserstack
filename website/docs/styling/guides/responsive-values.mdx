In this guide, we'll explore how to use responsive values.

## Creating a Renderer

First of all, we need to create our renderer and make sure to pass the [responsiveValuePlugin](/styling/api/plugins/responsiveValue) to it.

```tsx
import { createRenderer, responsiveValuePlugin } from '@weser/styling'

const [staticCSS, css] = createRenderer({
  hooks: {
    ':hover': 'hover',
    ':focus': 'focus',
    m: '@media (min-width: 800px)',
    l: '@media (min-width: 1024px)',
  },
  plugins: [
    responsiveValuePlugin([
      // these need to match the hooks we defined above
      // consider extracting those to a separate variable for better readability
      '@media (min-width: 800px)',
      '@media (min-width: 1024px)',
    ]),
  ],
})
```

With the plugin configured, our `css` function already supports responsive values.<br />
The problem is that we still get a type error when trying to pass an array to a style property.

> Ideally, this would work out of the box, but due to TypeScript limitations, we need to manually tell the type system that this is allowed.

## Passing Responsive Values

In order to pass responsive values, we need to use the [responsiveValue](/styling/api/responsiveValue) function.<br />
All this does is cast the value to the expected type.

```tsx
import { responsiveValue } from '@weser/styling'

const style = css({
  color: responsiveValue(['blue', , 'red']),
})
```

## Responsive Values as Props

On its own, this pattern is not very useful. But it shines when it comes to passing responsive values as props to components.
For example:

```tsx
const App = (
  <Box padding={[4, , 10]} flexDirection={['column', , 'row']}>
    <Box>Hello</Box>
    <Box>World</Box>
  </Box>
)
```

We can achieve this by utilizing the [T_ResponsiveValue](/styling/api/types/T_ResponsiveValue) type.

```tsx
import { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
import { T_ResponsiveValue, T_Style } from '@weser/styling'
import { css } from './renderer'

type ResponsiveStyleValue<T extends keyof T_Style> = T_ResponsiveValue<
  T_Style[T]
>

type Props = {
  padding: ResponsiveStyleValue<'padding'>
  flexDirection: ResponsiveStyleValue<'flexDirection'>
}
function Box({ padding, flexDirection, children }: PropsWithChildren<Props>) {
  return (
    <div
      style={css({
        display: 'flex',
        padding: responsiveValue(padding),
        flexDirection: responsiveValue(flexDirection),
      })}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```
