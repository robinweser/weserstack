title: Conditional Validation
order: 3

Besides basic form validation, we can also validate fields conditionally.<br />
This is useful when we want to validate a field based on the value of another field. A common example is when you have to confirm your password by typing it twice.

We can achieve this by using Zod's built-in [refine](https://zod.dev/api/zod#refine) method.

```tsx
import { z } from 'zod'
import { useForm } from '@weser/forms'

const schema = z
  .object({
    password: z.string(),
    confirm: z.string(),
  })
  .refine((data) => data.password === data.confirm, {
    message: "Passwords don't match",
    // the path is important to set the error message to the correct field
    path: ['confirm'],
  })
```
