Usually, we want to use the [useForm](/forms/api/useForm) hook to create form fields, but sometimes we might want to create a single one-off field that's not submitted itself, but still has validation rules.
We can achieve this by using the [useField](/forms/api/useField) hook. It's the low-level hook that's used under the hood by [useForm](/forms/api/useForm).

```tsx
import { z } from 'zod'
import { useField } from '@weser/forms'

const schema = z.string().min(3)

function Search() {
  const search = useField(schema, {
    showValidationOn: 'blur',
  })

  return <input type="search" {...search.inputProps} />
}
```
