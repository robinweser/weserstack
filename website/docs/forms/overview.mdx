A package for creating controlled forms in [React](https://react.dev) with built-in [Zod](https://zod.dev) validation.<br />
You own and control the rendered markup while the hooks take care of the state and validation.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/forms" />

## Installation

<Callout title="Required dependencies">
  This package relies on [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks)
  and thus requires version 16.3 or higher.
</Callout>

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/forms

# yarn
yarn add @weser/forms

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/forms
```

## Motivation

There are a dozen of form libraries out there already, so why create another one?<br />
Well, I wanted to create a form library that is simple, lightweight and easy to use without sacrificing performance.
Less boilerplate and more opinionated about how forms should be built.<br />
This is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather my very own codified approach to building forms.

## Benefits

This package provides a simple API for building forms with built-in Zod validation.
