<Callout type="warning" title="This package is deprecated">
  This package has been split into two separate packages: [@weser/array](/array)
  and [@weser/object](/object). Please migrate to these packages for future
  updates.
</Callout>

A collection of small, type-safe, performant & immutable iteration utilities for arrays and objects.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/loops" />

## Installation

<Callout title="Required dependencies">
  This package relies on [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hook)
  and thus requires version 16.3 or higher.
</Callout>

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/loops

# yarn
yarn add @weser/loops

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/action
```

## Motivation

Because JavaScript's native "functional" APIs such as `forEach`, `reduce`, `map` and `filter` are slow and limited to arrays only.<br />
There're many different utility packages out there already, e.g. [lodash](https://lodash.com).
But lodash's `reduce` method itself is 4.5kb gzipped which is way too much for a simple array/object reduce utility.

Additionally, it provides better type inference compared to the built-in methods.
