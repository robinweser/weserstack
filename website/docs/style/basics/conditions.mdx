Conditions are the foundation of this package. They allow us to use pseudo classes and at-rules like media queries with plain inline styles.<br />
It works by leveraging a [CSS Variable Trick](https://weser.io/blog/inline-styles-on-steroids#css-variable-trick).

## How It Works

Nick, the creator of [CSS Hooks](https://css-hooks.com), wrote a great [article](<https://weser.io/blog/%5Bhttps://nsaunders.dev/posts/css-madness-to-hooks%5D(https://nsaunders.dev/posts/css-madness-to-hooks/)>) where he explains the thought process behind creating css-hooks and how it works internally.
Here's a quick summary of the gist:

```css
* {
  --hover-off: initial;
  --hover-on: ;
}
:hover {
  --hover-off: ;
  --hover-on: initial;
}
```

```html
<div style="color: var(--hover-on, red) var(--hover-off, blue)">Hover me</div>
```

<Box marginTop={2}>
  <style
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      __html: `* {
  --hover-off: initial;
  --hover-on: ;
}
:hover {
  --hover-off: ;
  --hover-on: initial;
}`,
    }}
  />
  <Box
    padding={4}
    alignItems="center"
    justifyContent="center"
    bg="var(--colors-background-alternate)"
    style={{
      color: 'var(--hover-on, red) var(--hover-off, blue)',
      lineHeight: 1,
    }}
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: 'Hover me' }}
  />
</Box>

## Available Conditions

All of today this package allows a wide range of CSS selectors, pseudo classes and at-rules like media queries.

<br />
One can add a `&` as a placeholder for the actual element. With that, we can even create parent selectors that aren't possible with pure CSS.
For example: `div > &` would only resolve a style if the parent was a `div`.
