Finally, this package adds plugin support for custom logic.<br />
A plugin is just a pure function that takes a style object and returns a new style object.

## Included Plugins

<Callout title="Fela Plugins">
  This package is heavily inspired by the [Fela](https://fela.js.org) ecosystem.
  Therefore, many of the plugins are direct ports of [Fela
  plugins](https://fela.js.org/docs/latest/advanced/plugins). If you need
  additional Fela plugins, feel free to reach out or try to port them yourself.

By default, this package includes the following plugins:

- [debug](/style/api/plugins/debug)
- [enforceLonghand](/style/api/plugins/enforceLonghand)
- [prefixer](/style/api/plugins/prefixer)
- [responsiveValue](/style/api/plugins/responsiveValue)
- [sortProperty](/style/api/plugins/sortProperty)
- [unit](/style/api/plugins/unit)

## Creating a Plugin

Since a plugin is just a pure function that takes a style object and returns a new style object, we can create one by simply defining a function.<br />
For example, if we want to implement a simple logging plugin, we can do the following:

```ts
import { T_Style } from '@weser/style'

function loggerPlugin(style: T_Style) {
  console.log(style)
  return style
}
```
