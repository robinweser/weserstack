Fallbacks are a way to provide a fallback value for a property if the property is not supported by the browser.
Here's how this works in CSS:

```css
.element {
  width: -webkit-min-content;
  width: min-content;
}
```

In case the `min-content` value is not supported, the browser will use the prefixed `-webkit-min-content` version.

## Fallbacks in Inline Styles

The problem is that we can't use this type of fallback value with inline styles.<br />
In the past, one could hack it like this:

```ts
const style = {
  width: '-webkit-min-content; width: min-content',
}
```

But this was never officially supported and nowadays is not supported by React anymore.

We can however achieve this using CSS variables.<br />
In order to support this, we can use the following CSS:

```css
:root {
  --width-min-content: min-content;
}

@supports not (width: min-content) {
  :root {
    --width-min-content: -webkit-min-content;
  }
}

.element {
  width: var(--width-min-content);
}
```

Now, since this is very cumbersome to write, this package provides a convenient helper that can be passed to the [createRenderer](/style/api/createRenderer) function directly:

```ts
import { fallbackValue } from '@weser/style'

const minWidthFallback = fallbackValue('width', [
  '-webkit-min-content',
  'min-content',
])
```
