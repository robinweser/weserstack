A convenience layer and tool belt on top of inline styles for React.<br />
It aims to bring the [Fela](https://fela.js.org) ergonomics to inline styles.
It adds support for pseudo classes and at-rules like media queries to inline styles amongst many other nice features like vendor prefixing, responsive styling and more.<br />
This package works well in combination with the [theme](/theme/overview) and [keyframe](/keyframe/overview) packages.
