A package for working with server actions in [React](https://react.dev).

<PackageBadges package="@weser/action" />

## Installation

<Callout title="Required dependencies">
  This package relies on [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hook)
  and thus requires version 16.3 or higher.
</Callout>

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/action

# yarn
yarn add @weser/action

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/action
```

## Motivation

Using [server actions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions) in React is a great way to handle server-side logic in a type-safe way.<br />
But there's no straightforward way to handle things like loading states and errors. This requires quite some boilerplate that I wanted to reduce with this package.

## Benefits

This package provides a simple hook that handles the loading states and errors for you.<br />
It also provides a standard format for action responses so that every action follows the same pattern.
