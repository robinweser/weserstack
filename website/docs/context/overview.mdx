A package for working with [React context](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) in a more ergonomic way.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/context" />

## Installation

<Callout title="Required dependencies">
  This package relies on [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hook)
  and thus requires version 16.3 or higher.
</Callout>

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/context

# yarn
yarn add @weser/context

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/context
```

## Motivation

[Context](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) in React is a great way to pass data through the component tree.<br />
But the provided API is not very ergonomic. This package provides a convenience helper function to create both a use context hook as well as a provider component.

## Benefits

The same functionality that the built-in API provides, but in a more ergonomic way.<br />
Additionally, ever context automatically accepts `null` as a value to indicate "not set".<br />
The hook will throw an error if you try to use the context without a provider.
