A collection of small, type-safe, performant & immutable iteration utilities for objects.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/object" />

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/object

# yarn
yarn add @weser/object

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/object
```

## Recommended Usage

For the best developer experience, we recommend importing all methods under a namespace:

```ts
import * as object from '@weser/object'

const doubled = object.map({ a: 1, b: 2 }, (value) => value * 2)
const filtered = object.filter({ a: 1, b: 2 }, (value) => value > 1)
```

This allows you to use the methods with a clear namespace prefix, making it easy to distinguish them from native object methods.

## Motivation

Because JavaScript's native "functional" APIs such as `forEach`, `reduce`, `map` and `filter` are slow and limited to arrays only.<br />
There're many different utility packages out there already, e.g. [lodash](https://lodash.com).
But lodash's `reduce` method itself is 4.5kb gzipped which is way too much for a simple array/object reduce utility.

Additionally, it provides better type inference compared to the built-in methods.
