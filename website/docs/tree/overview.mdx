A collection of utilities for working with tree data structures.

<PackageBadges package="@weser/tree" />

## Installation

```sh
# npm
npm i --save @weser/tree

# yarn
yarn add @weser/tree

# pnpm
pnpm add @weser/tree
```

## Motivation

Pretty much every app I ever worked on needed a tree data structure at some point.<br />
Usually we'd end up writing our own implementation of a tree data structure and later run into issues with types or wrong abstractions.<br />
That's why I created this package to help me work with tree data structures in a unified way.

## Benefits

This package provides a set of utilities to help you work with tree data structures in a very convenient way.<br />
It's immutable and type-safe by design and helps you avoid common pitfalls when working with tree data structures.
