  and thus requires version 16.3 or higher.
</Callout>

Many apps include multiple layers of UI elements. Common examples are modals and overlays.
Managing them in a user-friendly, accessible way is not at all straightforward.

This package is often used in combination with the [useScrollBlocking](/hook/api/useScrollBlocking) and [useFocusTrap](/hook/api/useFocusTrap) hooks.

## Benefits

Allows you to manage nested UI layers in a simple and intuitive way.
